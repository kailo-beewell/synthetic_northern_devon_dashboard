# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) (with possible titles of 'added', 'changed', 'deprecated', 'removed', 'fixed', or 'security'),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

This should align with releases on GitHub (which will create and link to once have generated first stable release) (which is like a non-portable changelog only displayed to users within GitHub)

Writing of this changelog will be supported by comparison of main and forked repositories on GitHub, and from [changelog of the kailo_beewell_dashboard package](https://github.com/kailo-beewell/kailo_beewell_dashboard_package/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
